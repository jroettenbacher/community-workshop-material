## Overview

- Discuss several aspects of tabular data cleaning using R
- Presentation of a code in RStudio
- Create an untidy table and clean it
- Ideas how to deal with common issues
- Goal: clean data for example for data submission to a data repository


## Dealing with common issues

- Rows with comments / aggregated statistics
- Columns with NaN only
- Different ways of marking missing values
- Leading/trailing/double white spaces
- Decimal separator
- Convert data types
- Date and time in separate columns
- Several values in a single cell
- Convert latitude / longitude to decimal format

## Dealing with common issues (continued)
- Replace abbreviations
- Species column with misspelled species names
- Parameter names (table headers)
- Parameter with unit, that needs rescaling
- Unrealistically high number of decimal points
- URL check
- Add a column
- Save table
